     <h2>3D Printing</h2> 
   <p> 3D printing was not unfamiliar to me as I had done 3D printing before as part of another module.However, 
   I had not used the CURA software to 3D print before. After making my models in fusion 360, I exported the models to CURA software to "slice"
the model into a file which could be used to 3D print my models.</p> 

   <p> To make sure I had the right shape for the chess piece, I used a 2D drawing of a knight chess piece and traced over it using spline to ensure
   that my model came out accurate, I then scaled down the chess piece model to make sure that it was small enough to fit the printer and to drive
   down the print time. I also used shell to make the base hollow to further reduce print time</p>
