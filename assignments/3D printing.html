     <h2>3D Printing</h2> 
   <p> 3D printing was not unfamiliar to me as I had done 3D printing before as part of another module.However, 
   I had not used the CURA software to 3D print before. After making my models in fusion 360, I exported the models to CURA software to "slice"
the model into a file which could be used to 3D print my models.</p>
