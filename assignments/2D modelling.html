     <h2>Week 4 (2D modelling)</h2> 
   <p> In week 4, 2D modelling was taught in class. In 2D modelling, we were taught to use GIMP, a free photoshop software, and inkscape.
   For the 2D modelling module, we had to use gimp to cut out an image and make the background "transparent" 
   as well as create a logo in inkscape. As I had never handled GIMP or Inkscape before, I was extremely apprehensive about the module, however,
	with the lesson notes provided, as well as some help from my teacher, I was able to get it done.</p> 
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>For GIMP, we were required to pick a picture of ourselves, cut out the outline of our face/body and make the rest of the background
   transparent</p>
   <p> For my image, I picked this as it was the only image of myself that I had on my laptop</p>
   <br>
   <img src = "seth aditya sunil Photo.jpg" width = "120" height = "156"/>
   
   <br>
   <br>

   <p> After this, I opened up GIMP. Using GIMP, I removed the background and made it transparent: </p>

	<p> This is how the final image looked like </p>
