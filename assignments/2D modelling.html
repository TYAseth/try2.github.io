     <h2>2D modelling</h2> 
   <p> In week 2, 2D modelling was taught in class. In 2D modelling, we were taught to use GIMP, a free photoshop software, and inkscape.
   For the 2D modelling module, we had to use gimp to cut out an image and make the background "transparent" 
   as well as create a logo in inkscape. As I had never handled GIMP or Inkscape before, I was extremely apprehensive about the module, however,
	with the lesson notes provided, as well as some help from my teacher, I was able to get it done.</p>
