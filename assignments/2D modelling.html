     <h2>Week 4 (2D modelling)</h2> 
   <p> In week 4, 2D modelling was taught in class. In 2D modelling, we were taught to use GIMP, a free photoshop software, and inkscape.
   For the 2D modelling module, we had to use gimp to cut out an image and make the background "transparent" 
   as well as create a logo in inkscape. As I had never handled GIMP or Inkscape before, I was extremely apprehensive about the module, however,
	with the lesson notes provided, as well as some help from my teacher, I was able to get it done.</p> 
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>For GIMP, we were required to pick a picture of ourselves, cut out the outline of our face/body and make the rest of the background
   transparent</p>
   <p> For my image, I picked this as it was the only image of myself that I had on my laptop</p>
   <br>
   <img src = "seth aditya sunil Photo.jpg" width = "120" height = "156"/>
   
   <br>
   <br>

   <p> After this, I opened up GIMP. Using GIMP, I removed the background and made it transparent: </p>

    <img style = "width: 900px; height: 385.78px;" src = "Screenshot 2023-02-23 162752.png">
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<p> This is how the final image looked like </p>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
   
   <img src = "seth aditya sunil Photo.png" width = "120" height = "156"/>
   
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <p>I was also introduced to basic 2D drawing using Autodesk Fusion360 this session. At first, I was worried that this software would be too
   hard to use. However, upon some experimentation, I realised that the software was incredibly similar to Autodesk inventor, which I had used
   before as part of my normal modules.</p>
   <p> To start creating a 2D sketch, just simply click on "New Sketch" and then select the plane that you would like to sketch on. Once the sketch 
   is created, you will see a ribbon:</p>
   
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   
      <img style = "width: 900px; height: 385.78px;" src = "Screenshot 2023-02-24 131731.png">
	  <p> What you should see just before selecting a plane to sketch on </p>
	  
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <img style = "width: 900px; height: 385.78px;" src = "Screenshot 2023-02-24 131747.png">
	  <p>What you should be seeing after you create a sketch</p>
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p> Once you open up the sketch, the system is pretty straightforward. You select the function you want to use ( if you hover above
	  a function that you're not sure about, a small window will pop up with a description of the function ) and then you left click to execute
	  the function. The cursor automatically snaps to fixed points on a grid so you can easily start from (0,0) to make it easier to draw. When
	  drawing lines, the lines will automatically be straight and snap to certain angles as well, which means you can perfectly draw that horizontal
	  line!</p>
	  <p> Even for circles, all you need to do is select the centre point and key in the radius you want. It's very simple and hobbyist friendly.</p>
	  
	 <p> During our lesson, we practiced making 2D sketches using the 2D software. We were not supposed to extrude them, but I took the liberty to
	 extrude them. I have made them visible in week 5(3D modelling) if you want to take a look!</p>
