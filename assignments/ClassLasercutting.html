     <h2>Weeks 7-11 (Laser Cutting + Assignment)</h2>
   <p>In week 7, which was the final week of the term. we covered laser cutting as part of our lesson. Since this was my first time lasercutting
   I was not 100% sure of what to do</p>
   <p>First, we learnt how the cutter operated. The cutter made use of vector images to cut the wood using a high-powered laser beam. To make the
   2D sketches, we first used Fusion360 to make a 3D model of how our part was supposed to look like. Once that was done, we just had to right
   click on the sketches we used to generate the model and select the "save as dxf option" (although I personally created a new sketch and used
   the "project geometery" feature to make a fresh sketch of the parts and then saved those sketches as dxf.</p>
