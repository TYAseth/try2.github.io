     <h2>Weeks 7-11 (Laser Cutting + Assignment)</h2>
   <p>In week 7, which was the final week of the term. we covered laser cutting as part of our lesson. Since this was my first time lasercutting
   I was not 100% sure of what to do</p>
   <p>First, we learnt how the cutter operated. The cutter made use of vector images to cut the wood using a high-powered laser beam. To make the
   2D sketches, we first used Fusion360 to make a 3D model of how our part was supposed to look like. Once that was done, we just had to right
   click on the sketches we used to generate the model and select the "save as dxf option" (although I personally created a new sketch and used
   the "project geometery" feature to make a fresh sketch of the parts and then saved those sketches as dxf.</p>

   <p>The save as DXF logo is right above the Delete logo</p>
   
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <p>Once the image is saved as dxf, it can be dragged and dropped from its folder into CorrelDraw, a software provided by the lab</p>

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p> After  I finished placing my dxf files in correldraw, I simply hit "ctrl"+"P" to open the printer menu. In the printer menu, all I
	  had to do was, set the focus to depth, set speed, power and frequency values as well as number of cycles and thickness of material.
	  Then it was just the matter of hitting print and activating the cutter. To engrave instead of cut, I merely had to change the mode from
	  vector cut to engrave and not input any frequency.
