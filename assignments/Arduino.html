     <h2>Week 13 - 15 (Embedded Circuits)</h2> 
   <p> From week 13 - 15, we covered embedded circuits in class. The embedded circuits included the Arduino, the basic output devices, and
the basic input devices</p> 

<p>In week 12, the main arduino was covered. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
 Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - 
 activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to 
 the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based 
 on Processing. The Arduino company makes boards that are compatible with this software which are sometimes reffered to as "Arduino" as well.</p>
 

<p> The first thing we learnt to do was use a resistor and LED to make a basic circuit</p>

<p> Next, we learnt how to use DIP switches in conjunction with resistors and a 7-segment display to light up different segments based on
what numbers we turned on </p>

<p> For our assignment, we were required to create a coundown timer using a 7-segment display, arduino, and resistors</p>
