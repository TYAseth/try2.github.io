     <h2>Week 1 Lesson (FabLab)</h2> 
   <p>For the first week of lesson, we completed our Fablab safety quiz to ensure that we were qualified to use the equipment provided
   by the Fablab. Though it took me a couple of tries, I was able to pass the Fablab quiz with relative ease.</p>

   <p> Though it took me time to read up on the content and attempt the quiz, I understood the importance of the quiz as improper usage of
	equipment may cause damage to the equipment and it may put me in danger as well</p>

   <p> As you can see, despite taking 2 attempts, I managed to pass the Fablab quiz :) </p>
