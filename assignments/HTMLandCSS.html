     <h2>Week 3(HTML and CSS)</h2> 
   <p> Since week 2 was a public holiday (Diwali), our next lesson occured on week 3. In this lesson, we learnt how to create our own website
   using HTML and CSS. Since I had learnt programming languages such as C++ before. I thought that this would be easy. I  was wrong. HTML worked
   very differently from coding. You had divisions, infile CSS, CSS imported from another file, and you didn't use "" to denote text.
   Instead, whatever was written between ("< p > and < /p >") or ("< h1 >" and < /h1 >") was automatically treated as text. In fact, anything put
   inside "" was usually used to define functions such as class = "active" or href = "(website link)" as compared to C++ where text was in
   bracets while definition of functions were in plain text so it took me some time to wrap my heada around it</p>

   <p> Since it was my first time creating a website, my site looked something like this: </p>
   
   <br>
   <br>

   
   <img style = "width: 506.25px; height: 900px;" src = "IMG-20221030-WA0008.jpeg">
   
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>   
   
   <p>My code was also a hot mess at the time. It looked something like this: </p>
   
   <br>
   <br>
   
         <img style = "width: 900px; height: 385.78px;" src = "Screenshot 2023-02-23 155024.png">
		 
		 
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
	<br>   
   
   <p>However, after reading up more on website building during my free time, as well as getting help from my cousin who is studying computer
   engineering in university, my site started looking a lot better</p>
   
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <p>I modelled parts of my website after the brightspace website as I really liked the "cards" idea used by the website. This is the
   "finished" product (website was still in progress at the time of this pic):</p>

      <img style = "width: 900px; height: 385.78px;" src = "Screenshot 2023-02-23 154154.png">
	  
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <p>My code also started looking more coherent and I managed to formulate a template which I could apply to every part of my project. It ended
   up looking like this:</p>
   
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <img style = "width: 900px; height: 385.78px;" src = "Screenshot 2023-02-23 160031.png">
