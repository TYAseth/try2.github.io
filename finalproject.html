     <h2>Final Project</h2> 
   <h3><u> Ideation </u></h3>
   <p>The idea behind my project was inspired by the motion sensor lights used in school toilets. Motion lights are very useful as they increase
   convenience for us. We don't have to deal with switches to turn the lights on or off. All we need to do is walk in range of the senso, and the
   light will automatically turn on. Similarly, the light will turn off once we are out of the sensor range. Here is the initial sketch
   I made for the project. As you can see, while the concept remained more or less the same, the design went through some changes: </p>

   <p>Initially, I was thinking of using lightbulbs which required a relay to control the voltage, however, I ended up switching to neopixels
   as they were more economical. I also shifted the sensor to the bottom surface of the box and angled it at 45degrees so that it can detect people
   that are walking towards the light. I was also forced to modify the top cover to include a lid so that I could easily access the circuit for 
   maintainence and make any last minute changes if I needed to make them. To </p>

   <h3><u> Designing Process </u></h3>
   <p> Once I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do with my motion lights, I designed the circuit in TinkerCAD and tested it to make sure that
   it would actually function</p>

   <p>My code is also in the TinkerCAD if you wish to take a look at my code</p>
   <p> The live demonstration of my basic circuit will be included in a small video at the end of this page</p>
   
   <p> Once I had built my circuit, I started designing the items that I was going to cut and 3D print to make my box </p>
   
   <p> First up was the box body itself, designed using the ideas that I mentioned in the ideation stage</p>
