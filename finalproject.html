     <h2>Final Project</h2> 
   <h3><u> Ideation </u></h3>
   <p>The idea behind my project was inspired by the motion sensor lights used in school toilets. Motion lights are very useful as they increase
   convenience for us. We don't have to deal with switches to turn the lights on or off. All we need to do is walk in range of the senso, and the
   light will automatically turn on. Similarly, the light will turn off once we are out of the sensor range. Here is the initial sketch
   I made for the project. As you can see, while the concept remained more or less the same, the design went through some changes: </p>

   <p>Initially, I was thinking of using lightbulbs which required a relay to control the voltage, however, I ended up switching to neopixels
   as they were more economical. I also shifted the sensor to the bottom surface of the box and angled it at 45degrees so that it can detect people
   that are walking towards the light. I was also forced to modify the top cover to include a lid so that I could easily access the circuit for 
   maintainence and make any last minute changes if I needed to make them. To </p>

   <h3><u> Designing Process </u></h3>
   <p> Once I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do with my motion lights, I designed the circuit in TinkerCAD and tested it to make sure that
   it would actually function</p>

   scrolling="no"></iframe>
   
   <p>My code is also in the TinkerCAD if you wish to take a look at my code</p>
   <p> The live demonstration of my basic circuit will be included in a small video at the end of this page</p>
   
   <p> Once I had built my circuit, I started designing the items that I was going to cut and 3D print to make my box </p>
   
   <p> First up was the box body itself, designed using the ideas that I mentioned in the ideation stage</p>
   
   <iframe src="https://gmail2865400.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH9285eQTcf875d3c5398d613e9512339ffe?mode=embed" width="800" height="600" 
   allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
   
   <p>As can be seen in the design, the box is intended to represent a false ceiling or it can be ceiling mounted in box form. The sensor is
   placed on the tilted surface on the bottom to detect a person that is approaching the device. The ceiling mounted/false ceiling was inspired
   by my bathroom lights. 2 of my bathroom lights are in a false celing while for the central light, the cover is held in place using hooks</p>
   
   <p>Here are some images for refrence</p>

   <p>The central light. If you look closely, you can see the hooks used to hold it up </p>
   
   <p>Once I designed the box, I designed a holder to hold the PIR sensor so that it wouldn't fall from the angled board and become misaligned</p>
   <p> Initially, I used a holder with slender, cylinder shaped legs to hold the sensor (as can be seen in the 3D model), however, as the design
   was not very feasible, I was forced to change the holder design to a table-like shape as can be seen below:</p>

   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <p> The final part I designed was the "lampshade". The purpose of this "lampshade" was to provide me with a proper surface that I could line
   with a reflective material such as aluminium foil. The relective material would reflect the light rays and amplify the amount of light emitted
   by the device.</p>
   
   <br>
   <br>

   allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
   
   <br>
   <br>
   
   <p> Because the overall size of the "lampshade" was too large for the 3D printer, I split the lampshade into symmetrical halves and printed them at
   the same time. The reason I decided to go for 3D printing over laser cutting was because of the jutting out surface at the top. It would be easier
   to 3D print that kind of shape, as compared to lasercutting anf sticking the wood pieces together. It would also save space as I only needed to 3D
   print a thickness of 2mm, while the thinnest sheet of plywood is 3.5mm which is too thick </p>
   
   <p>Once the design was done, all I had to do was create the functions to program the 3D printer and laser cutter</p>
   
   <h3><u>Fabrication Process</u></h3>
   
   <p>First, I created the gcodes for 3D printing using cura, and the dxf files for laser cutting:</p>

   <p>These are the DXF files I used to cut my parts. You can notice that the PIR sensor holding board is using the slotted holes
   instead of the cylindrical ones in the final DXF</p>

   <p> After fabrication, I just had to assemble and test my device. The assembly and testing will be shown in the below video</p>
